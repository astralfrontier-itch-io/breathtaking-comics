# After the Crisis

## Playing through post-Crisis scenes

Once a Crisis scene ends, players should look at their resolved Drives and think back to how the scene went. Based on that, they can play through one or more scenes suggested by this outcome. Example scenes:

- A scene set immediately after the Crisis ends. For example, a character might engage with civilians who were rescued, attending to their needs and fears, or examine the wreckage of a building for clues about the villain's motivation.
- A scene set some time after the Crisis, as a hero follows up on the Crisis itself or engages in other business. For example, a character who fulfilled a Drive to capture a villain might interrogate that villain in prison, or make a report to police or government agents about what happened.
- A scene set in the character's civilian life, as we learn more about them as people or see the impact of their heroic life on their mundane existence. For example, we might see a character struggle to explain their mysterious absences to an employer or love interest, try to hold down a job, or pursue hobbies that keep them emotionally balanced.

Such a scene can be a brief summary (”I take my girlfriend Sally to her favorite restaurant to make up for ditching her at the theater, but it's expensive”). It can also be a full-fledged interaction between characters, where the group takes on different roles. For example, a hero's player might want to talk to the Feds about the Crisis, and ask other players to take up the role of Federal agents interested in the case.

The player of a hero doesn't have to be the one to suggest a scene for a hero. If Alice wants to hear more about Bob's character, she can use her editorial voice to suggest a scene. It's up to Bob to go along with it, though.

## Developing Drives

Players should look for opportunities to develop Drives for the next Crisis. This might be a continuation of the same Drive (e.g. if “capture a villain” was frustrated, you can just re-use that Drive), or an evolution of an old Drive into a new one (e.g. moving from “keep the MacGuffin from being stolen” to “retrieve the MacGuffin”). You can also decide a given Drive is at its logical end, and think up an entirely new one for the next Crisis.

A Drive doesn't have to be a standalone goal that only mattered during a single Crisis. It can be a milestone in a larger story arc. Characters interested in pursuing these longer-term stories can write a “meta Drive” for themselves, such as “I'll thwart the villain Monstro” or “I'll find the reason for all these giant monster attacks”. These don't function as in-game Drives, but as notes for the player about the direction for future Drives.

## Earning Memories and Sparks of Hope

At the end of a Crisis, each player rolls a single d20, plus another d20 for every Drive they resolved - whether frustrated or fulfilled. Take the highest number shown on all the dice.

- On a 1-2, the situation goes badly or turns awkward, and the group should decide how.
- On a 3-8, no unusual interactions happen.
- On a 9-12, the character generates a d6 Moment.
- On a 13-16, the character generates a d8 Moment.
- On a 17-20, they generate either a d10 Moment, or a Spark of Hope.

Characters can hold onto 3 Moments and one Spark of Hope. The specifics of a Moment need not be declared when it's generated. The player holding the Moment can do so then, or define it later by narrating a flashback to the specifics of what they experienced.

If a player engaged in a post-Crisis scene, these Memories might be based on those scenes, but don't have to be.
