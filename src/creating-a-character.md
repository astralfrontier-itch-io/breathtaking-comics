# Creating a Character

You might come to the table with no idea about a character. You might have an emotional arc or set of plot beats you want to hit, but no idea about superpowers and similar details. You might even have a fully baked hero concept you've always wanted to try.

Characters in this game are defined by two things: their power Facets (which change rarely) and their Drives (which change for every Crisis).

At the end of character creation, the group should introduce their characters to each other. This includes powers, backstories, ideas about story arcs, and so on.

## Power Facets

There is no menu of predefined superpowers to pick from. Players are free to declare that their characters' powers are anything they can imagine - control of an element, a half-human, half-alien physiology, psychic mastery, and so on.

“Gravity control” and “super-muscles” are superpowers. But do you use your mastery of gravity to fly fast, pin enemies to the ground, or open black holes through which you travel? Do your super-muscles mean you punch hard, tank massive damage with your face, or leap long distances?

To describe what a character can do, pick from three of the following six facets of power:

- **Confront**: you're good at going toe to toe with enemies, inflicting damage and taking punishment in return. Characters with built-in weapons, mastery of dangerous elements like fire, etc. all excel here.
- **Protect**: you focus on keeping yourself and others out of harm's way, and can resist, negate, or redirect all kinds of dangers. Characters with force fields, tough skin, or regeneration shine here.
- **Maneuver**: you're good at moving fast, staying hidden, or otherwise dominating the situation through positioning, wits, and tactics. Teleportation, super-speed, invisibility, super-intelligence, and flight are all typical powers.
- **Command**: your control of your body, your mind, an element, a force, or something else allows you to achieve amazing feats. Appropriate to characters with ice or gravity control, martial arts masters, and telekinetics.
- **Influence**: you can impress, persuade, intimidate, lead, or deceive people with displays of your power. Illusions, telepathy, flashy tricks, sonic powers, and more can be used for influence.
- **Adapt**: you have a broad array of options and can bring them into play as needed. Gadgeteers, magicians, characters who make creative use of their environment, and anyone else favoring variety are applicable here.

Assign a d10 to one facet, a d8 to another, and a d6 to a third. These are referred to as facet dice. You will roll these dice to make checks during play.

If you are called on to make a check that clearly belongs to a facet where you didn't assign any dice, you roll a d4.

## Starting Moments

Every character carries memories with them. Some can seem trivial, but become the most important thing in the world at the right time.

Note down that you have a Moment, and assign a d10 to it. You can define what it is now - inspiring words from a mentor, thoughts about your family, a formative experience you had - but you don't have to.

You can obtain new Moments after each Crisis has ended. You keep Moments until they are used.
