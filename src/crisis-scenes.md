# Crisis Scenes

A Crisis is a situation that demands a response from superheroes. A typical comic-book Crisis could be villains enacting awful plans, disasters (natural or otherwise) that threaten the populace, big moves from organized crime, or some other overwhelmingly powerful risk to life, liberty, and happiness.

The players create a Crisis together. First, each player defines their character's Drives. Then, the group weaves these Drives together into a scenario - a high-level narrative that explains what's happening. Finally, the group plays through the Crisis. They declare actions, make checks, and try and achieve a satisfying resolution to the story of the Crisis.

## Drives

Drives are how each player expresses what's interesting to them in a scene. Drives are an editorial mandate, indicating that something or someone will be part of the current Crisis.

Drives are aspirational statements. "I'll defeat my villainous nemesis", "I'll save the civilians", "I'll keep the Psychic Resonator out of the wrong hands", "I'll enact the Shadow Society's agenda", "I'll impress my hot teammate", and "I'll prove myself the strongest hero" are all meaningful Drives.

You don't write Drives in response to what will be in the scene - what you write for Drives determines the contents of the scene. If you write a Drive that says "I'll take on a powerful villain", the scene will have a villain. If a Drive says "keep my loved ones safe", your loved ones are present and in jeopardy. If you write a Drive about a Psychic Resonator or a Shadow Society, those things exist.

For characters, a Drive is something that stirs strong emotions. They aren't just abstract goals or vague intentions - they're powerful, seductive, compelling. Drives are things they'd do foolish, dangerous things to achieve. Whether the character wanted the Drive to come up or not, it did, and now they must navigate it.

Drives are created first to ensure that every player's authorial voice is heard. The resulting story should include input from everyone.

Drives can be specific or vague, depending on how clear you are on what you want to see in the scene. If you've just started playing, a vague Drive like "I'll take on a powerful villain" or "I'll look cool to everyone" is fine. If you have specific ideas or are developing a story arc for your character, you can write specific Drives like "defeat Professor Pulsar to avenge my fallen friends" or "save the bus-load of nuns".

## Writing Drives

Write down four Drives for your character. You should share what you've written with other players. Drives are not intended to be private.

Try to include a mixture of Drives from the following categories: confrontations with someone else, other mission objectives (like rescuing someone or capturing something), the character's personal goals and feelings, and relationships between teammates.

If everyone seems to share the same or similar Drive (e.g. "rescue the civilians"), the group can agree to make it a shared Drive. In this case, remove it from the characters' individual sheets and note it somewhere as a shared Drive.

Rate each Drive with a number from 1 to 3. The higher the rating, the more difficult it will be to achieve the Drive, but also to see it thwarted.

The total ratings of each character's individual Drives, plus any shared Drives, should be 7. For example, ratings of 3, 2, 1, 1 or 2, 2, 2, 1 would work.

> **Example Drives**
- A relationship with a villain. Name the villain and say what you want to do - defeat them, capture them, rehabilitate them, avenge yourself against them, and so on.
- Dealing with a natural disaster, such as a flood, tornado, earthquake, tsunami, etc., or an artificial or extraordinary disaster, such as a meteor, black hole, giant monster, runaway plasma explosion, etc.
- Attending to a group of people - the more specific, the better. "Save all the civilians" is okay, but "evacuate the trapped scientists" is more evocative and unique.
- A personal goal, such as achieving fame or notoriety, overcoming a weakness, impressing or intimidating someone else, developing a new power, etc.
- Advancing or changing your position on the team, promoting a team goal, striving for a leadership position, improving team morale, pursuing a rivalry with a teammate, or anything else that relates to your allies or the group as a whole.

## Weaving a Scenario

Once everyone has written their drives, the group should compare notes and find points of intersection. If there's a villain on the loose, a dam about to burst, and a MacGuffin that was stolen, it's logical to say the villain is using the MacGuffin to blow up the dam.

There can be two or more plot threads running through a scenario - not everything has to be connected. If a doctor needs the team's help to evacuate a cancer patient, that doesn't have to be related to the kaiju that's destroying downtown. But wherever possible, make an effort to tie things together in ways that make sense.

During this process, it's okay for players to rewrite their Drives to better match the needs of the scenario! But nobody should feel pressured to do so. Drives are about expressing what you want to see as a player, and it's the responsibility of the group to respect and promote that.

Once everyone feels confident about the scenario, discuss the Pressure Point - when the team arrives on the scene, what will be the most critical thing that needs handling?

Finally, decide whether Safeties are on or off for the crisis. Safeties on means play is safer, but can take longer. Safeties off should be for tense, high-stakes confrontations where anything can happen. Safeties off also means that characters can share Drives, or even have conflicting Drives - will G-Whiz redeem the Red Menace, or will her teammate Charcoal take him down for good?

Some common scenario structures:

- The villain's schemes endanger civilians (this is one I've used through many examples here)
- A conflict between villains spawns chaos and calamity!
- Natural disasters meet man-made malice!
- Human vices and desires go out of control when power is misused
- A civic function or society event is disrupted
- Invade a headquarters, base, hideout, or lair to thwart an ambition nearing fruition
