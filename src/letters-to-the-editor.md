# Letters to the Editor

At the end of each session, each player should imagine a "letter to the editor" - a message from a comic reader, giving their feedback about the action. The letters we'll hear about should be a mixture of constructive feedback or opinion about the story and characters, and hopes or requests for future content.

Players should take turns reading their letter aloud. Every player whose characters or situations were mentioned in the letter should get an opportunity to respond at the end. This can mean coming up with new ideas for Drives, or even rebuilding a character's powers in accordance with their concept.

Letters are not a substitute for safety tools or necessary conversations. If you have issues to resolve with another player, you should resolve those directly with the player. It is everyone's responsibility to play safely with each other.
