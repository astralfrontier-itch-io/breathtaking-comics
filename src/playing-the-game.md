# Playing the Game

This is a game for one or more players. It can be played either as a standalone game, taking 2-3 hours, or across several sessions of play.

## Materials you need

You'll need a set of polyhedral dice - a set of dice with 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sides - and a way to take notes. If you are playing digitally, you can make a copy of a Character Keeper to track characters:

## What the game asks of you

As a player, you are in a group of creators, working collaboratively on a character-driven graphic novel or comic book. You will be creating a specific superhero character and narrating their actions. But you will also be shaping the world and the story as a whole.

Everyone in the group has authorial and editorial control over the fictional parts of the game. That means that you can create whatever new elements you want, and you can make suggestions about existing elements brought in by other people. Declare that a supervillain exists - announce that suddenly ninjas appear - introduce a bus full of school kids that are in peril - say that a teleporter whisks the bad guys away at the last moment - it's all good.

The game will function best if you assert yourself in these roles. Please speak up when you have an idea to share. As a member of the group, you should also encourage other players to speak up even if they are hesitant to do so. You should also not speak over other people, and you should intervene if someone else is doing so. Defend your voice and the voices of others.

When players talk to each other about this creative process, they can speak in terms of comic book visuals - word balloons, panels and pages, visual and sound effects.

During a session, the players will create characters (if they haven't done so already), then play through a crisis, then play through one or more optional downtime scenes. If the group is interested and there's time left over, the group can start a new crisis during the same session and repeat the process.

Players shouldn't create characters ahead of time, but it's best if you come to a session with some kind of idea about a superhero character you're excited about. If you have ideas about villains and comic-book peril and so on as well, so much the better.

Every player should at least glance through this document. There is no “Game Master” or other privileged player, so everyone should have at least some idea about how the rules work.

## Editor in Chief

If the group prefers, one player can take the role of Editor in Chief (EIC). This player won't have a hero character. Instead, they focus on keeping track of elements in the Crisis, like villains, complications, and Drives.

In particular, the EIC's purpose is to make sure that under-utilized Drives are kept relevant to the scenario, and that complications are not neglected. For example, the EIC might keep a countdown clock and every few actions, remind players about a Drive that hasn't come up. They might also suggest ways to resolve an action or narrate for villains or civilians on the scene.

Any player can do all the things the EIC does. Groups should only use an EIC if they find that keeping track of these details at the same as everyone runs a hero is too complicated.
