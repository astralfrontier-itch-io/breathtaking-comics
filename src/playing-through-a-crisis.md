# Playing through a Crisis

When the crisis scene begins, one or more characters should turn their attention to the entry point - the most immediate part of the crisis. They will use their powers or wits to handle it, then move onto other parts of the crisis. During play, failed rolls or partial successes can also introduce new problems to solve, or make existing problems worse.

There are two ways to decide when the scene ends. The first is by mutual consent - if everyone is satisfied with the outcome, that's good enough. The second is to set a threshold - for example, an average of two resolved drives per character - that will trigger the end of the scene.

## Principles of play

While playing in the scene, try to follow these principles.

**Give problems a face**. We empathize with named, defined people over unknown masses or big crowds. If there's civilians in danger, name a few of them or describe a family huddled in a car, or otherwise give them a human presence. Let the hero's actions toward them stand in for the fate of the civilians as a whole. Make their problems personal.

**Make the heroes see things through**. It's not enough to just pull someone out of a burning building and forget about them. The building threatens to collapse, or the rescued person tells the hero there's someone else inside, or they're having trouble breathing and need to be taken to the paramedics. Look for new problems that you can develop from a situation the players are invested in.

**Present tough, personal choices**. Create situations that set characters' Drives in opposition, both for a single character and within the group. Stop the villain or rescue the hostage? Take it slow, or go in fast? Turn the villain over to the authorities, or avenge your friends?

**Create just a few more problems than there are heroes**. If there's four heroes on the scene, have five challenges. Or six. They don't all have to be equally disastrous - just create tension by making the heroes deliberately decide what to tackle.

**Don't kill anyone.** There's lots of ways for a team to fail at Drives like “save the civilians” without invoking mass slaughter. People can suffer from smoke inhalation or serious injuries. Families can be torn apart by raging flood waters. Residents can lose their homes to fire or other calamity. Similarly, villains should be captured or beaten, but not simply murdered.

**Exploit vulnerabilities**. If a hero is in the middle of pulling a family from a burning car suspended over a raging river, that's the moment for the villain to strike. If a hero is holding up a collapsing ceiling, have something new come up that demands their attention too. If a hero has a villain in their sights, reveal a hostage, trap, or contingency.

**Circle back to the heroes' chosen problems**. Chandler's Law states, “When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.” If nobody has a clear idea of what their next action should be, push forward a character's Drive - preferably a Drive that hasn't seen much play recently - by narrating something that happens in relation to the Drive, and then asking for a reaction. For example, if a character has a Drive like “defeat a villain”, have the villain make a move, like attacking civilians, and ask what the heroes are doing to stop that.

## Making checks

When there's a challenge that needs to be overcome, you make a check to see how it plays out. You only need to roll if what you are doing is risky or uncertain. Ideally, every challenge will connect to someone's Drives.

When the group agrees on what's at stake, you pick a Power Facet or a Moment, and roll the die that matches its rating. Take the highest die and interpret the results.

- On a 1-2, you fail, and something wrong happens.
- On a 3-4, you succeed, but at a cost.
- On a 5+, you succeed. The higher the result, the better the effect.

Whenever you roll a Power Facet or Moment die, you will step it down by one size. The path for stepping down is d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4. So for example, if you roll a d10, the next time you roll that particular Facet or Moment, you'd roll a d8, and then a d6, and so on. Don't step down past d4.

A check can mean a moment in time, or several seconds of back-and-forth fighting, or even minutes of dedicated rescue work. Make sure everyone agrees how much time will pass during a given check.

## Using Moments and Sparks of Hope

Moments can be used as though they were Power Facets. Moments step down like powers (e.g. reducing one die size) when used. They do not regenerate after Spiraling, however. If a Moment would step down to a d4, it is instead lost.

A Spark of Hope allows a character to “unresolve” a frustrated drive, either for themselves or someone else. This doesn't remove any marks on its frustration track, but does give an opportunity to keep pursuing the Drive, hopefully to resolve it as fulfilled. Once used, the Spark of Hope is gone.

Characters start with a Moment. They can gain more Moments and Sparks of Hope during downtime.

## Oracle Checks

The group can also progress a situation or make a luck-based check by picking a die size and rolling it. Roll a d4 if things are already bad, a d6 for 50-50 odds, or a d8, d10, or d12 for increasingly better chances of a good outcome. This kind of roll is called an Oracle Check.

> **Example checks**
> 
> - Use the “control gravity” power to fling an enemy at a building. On a roll of 5+, the action might succeed and help fulfill a drive like “defeat the villain”. On a failure, it might frustrate a drive like “save everyone in danger”, as the building collapses around terrified civilians.
> - Use the “create force fields” power to block an enemy's charged-up energy blast. In this case the character is reacting to someone else's action, but they still make the check.
> - The characters kept a dam from bursting earlier, but there are still cracks in it. The group decides to make an Oracle Check. They decide the odds are 50-50, and so roll a d8 to see whether it's holding. On a 5+, everything is fine. On a 3-4, what they did might not hold for long, and on a 1-2, it might need immediate attention - or burst open immediately!

## Fulfilling and Frustrating Drives

Each Drive has two tracks: fulfilled and frustrated. You can fill each of these tracks a number of times equal to the Drive's rating. For example, a Drive with rating 2 can have two marks of fulfillment and two marks of frustration on it. Marks on Drives cannot be undone - it's possible for a Drive to be close to both fulfillment and frustration.

The easiest way to handle success or failure is to mark fulfillment or frustration on a character's Drive. For example, if a character attacks a villain and fails, they can mark frustration on their “stop the villain” Drive (if they have one). Then, narrate how that Drive came closer to resolution - the villain was injured on success, an attempt at rescuing trapped civilians backfired on a failure, and so on. Success at a cost might mean fulfillment of one Drive and frustration of another - the hero was able to keep the civilians safe, but the villain got away.

When you would mark a Drive as frustrated or fulfilled and no marks are left, that Drive is resolved. The civilians are definitely safe, or the villain escaped to fight another day, or the dam burst after all, or whatever. The Drive cannot be pursued any further during the scene.

If all of a character's Drives are frustrated, they are taken out of the scene. This doesn't mean that they're knocked unconscious, but it could. It can also mean they chase after the fleeing villain, leaving their teammates to deal with the rest of the crisis. It could mean they dedicate all their efforts to saving civilians, no matter what else happens. Whatever the specifics, though, that character can no longer take actions or make checks.

What does it mean to fulfill, frustrate, or resolve a yes-or-no, one-time binary Drive? What if you have a Drive like “take a massive hit and shake it off”, you could look at it a few ways. TODO

## Safeties On and Off

When Safeties are On, your Drives are only affected if you participated in rolling a check. For example, if two people have some variation on “save civilians” as a Drive, and one of them fails a check, only that character's Drive will be frustrated. If the characters both made a team check, both of their Drives would be frustrated in that case, but not anyone else's.

When Safeties are Off, any check or other action that would logically frustrate or fulfill anyone's Drives will do so, as interpreted by the group as a whole. This means that two or three characters' Drives could have frustration - or fulfillment - marked on a single roll!

The group should always agree when a check would apply to multiple Drives with Safeties Off.

## Complications and failures

Aside from frustrating a drive, failures and complications on a check could mean the following:

- A villain has the initiative, and someone must make a check to resist or avoid their next move
- An escalating situation gets out of hand and demands someone respond to it
- A new character is introduced, or an existing character is highlighted, and placed in (more) peril
- A new facet of an existing situation develops - e.g. during a powerful hurricane, power goes out at a vital facility

## Team Checks

Multiple characters can participate in a check. Everyone rolls their relevant Power or Moment die, and the check is based on the highest value rolled. However, everyone's die steps down by a die size, and everyone's Drives can be fulfilled or frustrated by the outcome, regardless of Safeties.

## Spiraling

To reset all your Power Facets to their original rating, you can “spiral” - engage in one of your Drives with an unhealthy single-mindedness and a sudden outpouring of power. It can be done at any time, even during combat.

When a character spirals, the group looks at the scene and collectively decides on a new complication for the situation. This can be collateral damage, distraction from something that demands attention, the arrival of a new enemy, and so on. This new complication should function as a Pressure Point, demanding immediate action from the team.

The good news is that your spiral can accomplish amazing feats. When you spiral, roll a check with a d12 to achieve something appropriate to what you're feeling. This die does not step down the way power dice do. The new complication from a Spiral is in addition to any success at a cost that results from the roll, and the roll can still fail.

Spiraling resets your Power Facet dice to their normal values. It does not affect Moments.

> **Example Spiral**
> 
> G-Whiz thought she had the dam situation figured out. But now it's showing cracks, and water is about to break through! This isn't supposed to happen - she's supposed to be a genius scientist! Her mounting frustration and hero complex combine, and she rips bits of material out of the town and landscape, jamming it all against the dam with her prodigious gravity powers! She rolls a d12 to see if it fixes the dam. It does, but the group decides that she's also caused a lot of extra (and expensive) damage, and either scared or endangered a lot of people! Calming down the crowd and keeping them from being hurt becomes an immediate priority.
