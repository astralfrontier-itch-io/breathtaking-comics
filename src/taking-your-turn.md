# Taking Your Turn

Part of this answer is easy. On every action, you should be pursuing your Drives - or helping another player pursue theirs.

But which Drive? And how do you connect what just happened with what you are about to do?

If you don’t have a good answer, you can use one of these ideas.

### Zoom In

- Do this if you want a breather from the action and wish to see a more personal, emotional side of the crisis
- Suggested Drives: team or personal Drives, e.g. impressing or persuading someone
- Examples:
    - You looked good doing something just now, and can capitalize on that. How?
    - You screwed up or miscalculated, and now have to make up for it. How?
    - Some aspect of your personal life or secret identity - your workplace, a family member or loved one, etc. - becomes embroiled in the Crisis.

### “Meanwhile…”

- Do this if you’re satisfied with how things are going with other players’ Drives, or feel like a problem or complication hasn’t been sufficiently addressed
- Suggested Drives: any Drive we haven’t seen progress on lately
- Examples:
    - A fire is spreading, a building is about to collapse, civilians on the scene are panicking.
    - Criminals, low-level villains, or other opportunists are trying to take advantage of the chaos. Do you divert your attention to deal with them? At what cost?
    - You notice someone who can’t escape the scene on their own. What stops them?

### “But Wait!”

- Do this if you think things are going too easily and want to spice up the Crisis with a surprise complication
- Suggested Drives: any
- Examples:
    - A villain appears on the scene, and they have a history with you. Who is it?
    - Hostile reinforcements arrive, such as a getaway vehicle or well-armed soldiers. Who?
    - A shift in the physical environment, e.g. fissures in the ground open up, a smoke cloud obscures the scene,

### “Together…!”

- Do this if you want to emphasize teamwork and cooperation
- Suggested Drives: team drives or another player’s drives
- Examples:
    - Your teammate almost had it, but something happened and you have to help. How?
    - Only you have noticed a surprise threat to a teammate or their efforts, and only you can stop it in time. What did you see?
    - Only your powers or skills can enable a teammate to do something important. What?
